# **App Name**: Frnz Estates

## Core Features:

- Property Listings: Display properties in a responsive grid layout with key details like price, location, and images. Use pagination to load properties in batches, with a 'Show More' button.
- Property Search and Filters: Allow users to search for properties based on location and property type. Show and hide a Filter Sidebar based on breakpoint.
- Property Details: Property detail pages that render HTML content in iframe for security reasons, featuring an image carousel, property details, Google Maps integration, and an enquiry form.
- Loading Bar: Loading bar under the navbar to indicate page loading progress. The loading bar is the only visual indicator allowed during loading events.
- Location Selection: Use Google Maps to set location for the new properties.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft violet (#030712) to evoke a sense of calm and sophistication, while avoiding cliches in real estate visuals.
- Background color: Dark gray (#2A272E), a desaturated version of the primary color, in keeping with the requested dark theme.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#ffffff), slightly desaturated and brighter than the primary to add depth.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif; Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for short text
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Lucide React icons: Simple, consistent icons for navigation and property details.
- Mobile-first approach with a responsive grid layout and a fixed, blurring navbar.
- Smooth page transitions and hover effects using Framer Motion.
